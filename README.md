# GamesAnalysis
Analysis of Steam's gaming data to uncover how the release date, developer, and opinions affect the sales.


## Objectives:

Temporal Analysis: By examining the relationship between release dates I'm looking for patterns regarding seasonal trends, launch strategies, and long-term market impact.

Developer and Publisher Influence: Review the role of developers and publishers in-game sales.

Market Segmentation:  I'm categorizing games to identify which genres are the most lucrative, allowing for targeted analysis of niche markets and genre-specific trends.
